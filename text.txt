How should we handle decommissioned datasets?
Should there be a dedicated endpoint for MZ to call in order to delete a decommissioned dataset? Given the nature of such changes, should this deletion be processed immediately?
Update frequency from MZ:
Should MZ push updates to us as soon as a dataset is modified, or would it be more appropriate for them to send updates at regular intervals?
Payload structure for updates:
Should we require MZ to send a consolidated payload containing all modified datasets in a single request—allowing us to iterate through each dataset internally—or should we support one request per dataset?
