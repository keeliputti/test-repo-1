This is regarding the sacr_reault_rwa dataset.
I'm attaching two config files stored in DZ:

The earlier version when the GET query was working
The latest version where the GET query is failing
Could you please confirm if the configurations in both files match, and whether the schema and query are aligned with your Snowflake database setup?
Also, just to confirm — there haven’t been any changes to the underlying database/table, correct?

Thanks,
Supriya
