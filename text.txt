The latest version (2025.03.03) fetches dependencies from Artifactory, but some clients may still face issues as they continue fetching dependencies from AFS.
Switching back to AFS is not an option, as it leads to Train Contract Validation failures due to a policy update ([link]), preventing any new releases with AFS dependencies.
Clients using older dzjava versions remain unaffected.
Some users had to manually add certain dependencies, even for AFS-based versions, as JAR files do not include the libraries they ship with.
