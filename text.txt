While upgrading msjava/parts & Gradle, my build and tests passed, but the deployment failed due to:

Train contract validation failure: <link>
Error: VMS:ossjava/hadoop/2.7.4 - Security validation result is ERROR.

This issue is unrelated to my changes—all deployments are blocked due to a policy update (<Jive doc link>), which marks certain packages as failing builds since Feb 14, 2025.

Upgrading a package in VMS takes 2-3 months due to MSDE’s limited support for the manual process. After discussing with Application Infrastructure, we concluded that fetching dependencies from Artifactory is the best solution.

To address this, I’ve enabled dual-dependencies for dzjava and validated it with clean builds (snippet attached). Requesting approval for this approach: <PR link>.

Once deployed, we’ll test the latest dzjava artifact before sharing it with the client.
