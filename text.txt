Great direction! Here’s a polished and professional version of your full message, incorporating your intent and phrasing suggestions:

We have an HTTP connector available — you can expose an API that connects to 3Forge, and this API can then be accessed via Datazone.

The API can also be secured. If needed, you can restrict access by allowing only specific `proid`s (like ours) to call the API.

To help you get started, here’s a sample recipe dataset you can refer to for understanding the connection parameters used with HTTP:

\[**<link to sample recipe dataset or dataset name>**]

For your HTTP connection, you'll need to configure the following parameters:

* `url`
* `httpMethod`
* `requestHeaders`
* `queryParams` *(if applicable)*
* `authentication` *(if securing the API)*

Let us know if you need any help with the setup or parameter values.
