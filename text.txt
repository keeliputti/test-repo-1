I reviewed Aditya’s PRs on enabling parallel storage of bucket configs to the config store. It looks nearly complete and is just awaiting approvals.

The first step before enabling this feature would be migrating the existing configs. Pallavi’s changes have been merged, so I’ll check with her to see what’s left.

I also spoke with Aditya, and he’s aiming to wrap this up by Thursday.
