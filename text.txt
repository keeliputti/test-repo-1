Boldizsar has onboarded the dataset valuation control/inflation soa/breakeven ve bef infto to the Config Service in QA.
Since this dataset integrates with the DAL service, it needs to be configured to run in the dedicated dzdal team instance.

Could you please help with the necessary configuration changes in si_proid_config to support this?
