Yes, we do have a PR Validator in place that posts validation results directly on the pull request. It did run successfully for Gao’s PR and returned a positive response.

Based on our current Pydantic schema, all fields were validated as expected: link to repo. I’ll connect with Ehoussou to understand what additional validations might be implemented on their side.

That said, here are two improvements we should consider on our end:

Add a DAP group existence check in the PR validator script.
Update the Pydantic schema to reject empty strings within lists.
