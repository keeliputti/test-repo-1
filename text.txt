**Subject:** Aligning on dzjava Release Issues & Next Steps  

Bringing everyone up to speed on the dzjava release challenges due to Train Contract Validation errors.  

- **Issue:** dzjava, published as a library to AFS, fails deployment due to a Train Contract Validation error linked to **VMS: ossjava/hadoop/2.7.4**, requiring an upgrade. Since no newer version exists in **msjava/parts**, we initially opted to fetch dependencies from Artifactory.  
- **Infra Guidance:** App Infra advised that AFS-deployed libraries must rely solely on AFS dependencies. To address this, I’ve raised a **Snack request for VMS: ossjava/hadoop 2.7.4**.  
- **Next Steps:** Nido suggests testing with the latest released version for early feedback. Additionally, we could try an earlier version of **ossjava/hadoop** (not listed in the blocked policy) to see if it passes Train Contract Validation.  

Would appreciate thoughts on this approach, especially from Nido.
