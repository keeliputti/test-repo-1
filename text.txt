It's a Bucket Dataset, and the necessary configurations have been added.

While debugging locally, I found that the provider object creation fails because it isn't found in PROVIDER_BASE_PATH: <link>.

My question isâ€”do we support sample data for buckets at all? I noticed that on failure to initialize the Provider object, a Bucket object is initialized instead (within a try-except block): <link>.

Looking forward to clarification.

Thanks,
