**Subject:** Accessible Dataset Configuration Now Fetched from Config Service in QA

Hi Team,

We‚Äôve completed the migration of **Accessible Community Dataset configurations to Config Service** in the QA environment.

As part of this change:
- Configurations are **now stored in Config Service (`config_store`)**, in addition to the existing AFS location, with every non-prod Accessible deployment.  
  *(Previously, these were stored only in the AFS location.)*
- Configuration fetching has been switched from **AFS to Config Service**.

We‚Äôve tested a few datasets in QA and things look good so far. I‚Äôll continue to monitor **datazone-help** for any issues or feedback related to this change.

We intend to keep these changes in QA for a week before moving to PROD.

For reference, please find:
- [JIVE doc](#)
- [PR](#) for enabling fetch from `config_store`

üîÅ **To revert to the earlier setup**:  
Increase the monitor count for `dznode.dzaccessible` nodes in the respective environment.

üîÅ Rollback Info:
In case we need to revert to the previous behavior, please increase the monitor count for dznode.dzaccessible nodes in the respective environment.

‚Äî

Let me know if you'd like to include dataset names or expected PROD timelines.
