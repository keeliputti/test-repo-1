We suspect the issue is due to the 'st role' not being set in your Snowflake configuration.

Could you please try specifying it and see if that resolves the problem? You can refer to dzc get dataset config (recipes/config-service/snowflake, config type: "config-service") for guidance on setting the configurations correctly.
