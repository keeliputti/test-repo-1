For better readability in Jive, bullet points would be a good idea. Hereâ€™s how you can structure it:  

**dzjava Release Blocker: Dependency Issues**  

- Any developments or changes in dzjava **cannot be released** or provided as a new version.  
- Clients using **older dzjava versions remain unaffected**.  
- **Dependency fetching:**  
  - The latest version (**2025.03.03**) fetches dependencies from **Artifactory**.  
  - Previous versions fetch dependencies from **AFS**.  
- Some users had to **manually add certain dependencies**, even for AFS-based versions, as JAR files do not include the libraries they ship with.  

This keeps it clear and scannable. Let me know if you need further refinements!
