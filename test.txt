The goal of this project is to dynamically fetch the latest Pydantic model using **datamodel-code-generator**, along with its dependencies. We'll implement this in stages with thorough testing:

1. **Initial phase**: This phase will first support clients using **.version** (via AFS). Adding the minimal required dependencies for Python 3.7.5 to `requirements_***.txt`.  
2. **Testing**: Once tested in dev and QA environments, we'll proceed to the next phase.  
3. **Subsequent phase**: Update **dopy** and **c-service**:
   - Add endpoints in **dopy** to fetch the latest model from the server.
   - Add new methods in **c-service** to return the Pydantic model schema.

Here are the relevant PRs:
- PR for adding minimal dependencies to `requirements.txt`
- **dopy** changes: <link>
- **c-service** changes: <link>
