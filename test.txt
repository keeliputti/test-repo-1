Dear Team,

We are excited to announce a significant enhancement to the dfclient. OAuth 2.0 is now enabled for the GET API, improving security by replacing username-based authorization with industry-standard tokens. This feature is SecArch approved and reduces the exposure of a single application's proid accessing all datasets, allowing for user-based, granular level entitlement control.

This feature is available with dzjava version 2024.08.27-42 and above. Please refer to the *** documentation: [G***h](link) for detailed instructions, including a working example, documentation, and sample code.

For a practical example, please see the [link to perform *** API call with OAuth token](link).

This update is production-ready and we encourage you to start using it to benefit from the enhanced security and control.

If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
