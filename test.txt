Which MZ field(s) does the vendor field map to?
There are no other config changes apart from the vendor update — could you help us understand why this change is reflected as a metadata update?
In this dataset, the metadata shows a change in the vendor field — from a list value to null. However, based on the config in the repository, it doesn’t appear to have had a value set in the first place. [Link to repo]
