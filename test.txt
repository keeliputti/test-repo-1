General Audience Instructions:
Retrieve Credentials:
Securely fetch the client_id and private_key needed to create and sign the JWT.
Generate a JWT Bearer Token:
Create a signed JWT using the retrieved client_id and private_key, with claims that include the issuer, subject, audience, issue time, and expiration time.
Perform the Token Exchange:
Use the JWT Bearer Token and a subject token in a POST request to the OIDC token endpoint.
Include necessary parameters such as grant_type, scope, subject token, client_assertion_type, and client_assertion in the request body.
Handle the POST request using a retry mechanism for robustness.

### Summary Workflow:
1. **User performs OAuth 2.0 authorization** to obtain an initial access token.
2. **Client application retrieves required credentials** (e.g., Client ID, private key) from a secure storage system.
3. **Prepare and sign a JWT** for the token exchange.
4. **Make an HTTP POST request** to the token endpoint with the signed JWT and the initial OAuth token.
5. **Receive the exchanged token** and use it for subsequent API requests.

These steps ensure that the user is ready to execute a secure and compliant token exchange process.
