**Subject:** Temporary Exclusion of Dataset Configuration from Loader

Hi \[Recipient's Name],

Setting configurations for a dataset is generally a one-time requirement. Currently, however, the way things work is that when there are no changes in the catalog fields of the configuration, Metazone (which the config service connects to) errors out while attempting to re-register the same configurations.

Would it be possible to temporarily keep the dataset configuration out of the loader while we investigate potential improvements on the config service side?

Thanks,
Supriya
