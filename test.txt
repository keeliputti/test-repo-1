**Request for Approval: Initial Dependency Addition**

The goal is to dynamically fetch the latest Pydantic model using datamodel-code-generator**. To start, I propose the following initial step:

1. **Add minimal required dependencies for Python 3.7.5 to `requirements.txt`** to support clients using **kg** (via AFS).

Upon successful testing in dev and QA environments, we will plan further phases to support pip installable clients and update **dopy** and **c-service**.

Please review and approve the initial changes in this PR:

This version is more concise and directly requests approval for the initial changes, without delving into the later phases.

The goal of this project is to dynamically fetch the latest Pydantic model using datamodel-code-generator. For now, Iâ€™m proposing the following initial changes:

Add the minimal required dependencies for Python 3.7.5 to requiremen.txt.
This will support clients using mz.version.addpkg (via AFS).
Once these changes are tested in dev and QA, we can discuss further phases, including support for pip installable clients.

This keeps the message short and focused on the initial changes, requesting approval for only what's relevant right now. What do you think?
