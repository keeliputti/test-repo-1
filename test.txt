We noticed that a previous release of these datasets had vendor=[], whereas the latest release has vendor=null.

In an earlier version, we had updated the Pydantic schema, which introduced a change in default values across datasets. For dznode.starts.ied, this was picked up before the schema was reverted, resulting in the shift from [] to null.

If the intended metadata update is indeed from [] to null for the vendor field, we would need explicit approval to align with the current Pydantic schema.

Could the MZ team please confirm what metadata change is currently under review for these datasets? The Metadata Update page does not clearly reflect the change.
