He explains quite well, has good knowledge on library vs service - with each's pros & cons, hence we was majorly able to contribute to departs-config-manager. His key contributions involve:
> designing & implementing setter & getter endpoint of config-service
Lakshmi had praised him for effective adding zookeeper lock when writing to gpfs, and was jokingly saying - "Look how smartly he added this logic to Config Service, he could have added to dznode as well" 

> designing & implementing versioning in setting versioning in config-store
> He has also contributed towards partitioning supporting multi-level partitioning in config_store, which involved getting good understanding Arrow reader, writer.
> His knowledge in Fast-API has allowed him to write good code for server side of Config-service.

> When I was implementing - avoiding Onboarding non-default version configs to config-service, and thinking of scenarios to handle, to my surprise these were already taken care in the set endpoint thus making achieving my work(can we use different word instead or 'my work' or 'my task') easier

> all Error Handling in config service has been taken care by Aditya
> Aditya effectively also helps his juniors. He helped Pallavi understand Unit tests.
> Aditya is expertise himself in key technologies like Mongo which is used in Buckets & is now exploring Redis for caching solution in config-service.
> One of the tasks that mostly benefitted java users is enabling store endpoint for Native datasets.
> Me & Aditya have shared knowledge and resolved client issues related to Buckets.
