Performance & Impact

Introduction This year has been marked by significant client-side advancements —whether it was fixing bugs, managing dzpy dependencies, implementing dzpy dependencies testing tool, or adding new endpoints to dzpy and dzjava.

**1. Managing dzpy Dependencies**  
I got the opportunity to enhance the management of dzpy dependencies and improve the testing process for developers. This experience deepened my understanding of dependency management within dzpy, which is not widely known. The testing tool I developed was utilized by Sebastien & even by Backtester team, when they were making changes to dzpy dependencies

**Key Contributions:**  
- **Corrected dzpy dependencies:** Resolved import issues for `pip install` and `ms.version.addpkg()`, specifically addressing errors in Python 3.10.1.

- **Created a testing tool:** Developed a user-friendly tool for testing dzpy installation across Python versions (3.7.1, 3.10.1, 3.11.1) using Artifactory and AFS.  
  *Impact:* This tool has streamlined the testing process, eliminating the need for repetitive manual tests and enhancing efficiency for developers.


**5. Config-Service Contributions
Contributed to implementing key endpoints in dzpy for Config-Service; implemented Pydantic Models, which simplified user configuration and enhanced the overall experience; setting validations for ldap groups

**Key Contributions:**
Implemented set_*_config endpoints in dzpy: Ensured smoother interactions for users configuring various service aspects.

Provided Pydantic Models for users: Introduced Provider, Package, and Dataset models for easier configuration definitions.

Impact: Understanding configurations had long been a challenge in Datazone. This implementation directly addressed that issue. Additionally, my experience managing dzpy dependencies helped resolve related challenges within Config-Service, leading to a more efficient implementation.

Setting validation rules for dz-captains & dz-marshalls: allowing only existing members to be able to make updates, check that the ldap group exists

Avoid Onboarding dataset config versions, that is not the default version. Since MetaZone does not support versions, it would replace the existing configurations.

Resolve Sonar failures: was resoled by adding dzparts-config-manager to Sonar.


3.  **dzjava Client Enhancements** 
developed the store endpoint; resolved complex issues, such as Date and DateTime handling in Java. This was pivotal in onboarding clients

**Key Contributions** 
- **Developed store endpoint**: This endpoint played a major role in increasing dzjava client adoption, with multiple teams using the client to onboard datasets. 
- **Implemented OAuth token exchange, a SeArch approved feature**:
- Replaced username-based authorization with industry-standard tokens.
- Reduced exposure of a single proid accessing all datasets.
- Enabled user-based, granular entitlement control.
- Ensured a future-proof solution for teams like RICE and OPTIMUS, which plan to implement this.

- 4. ### **Accessible Framework**  
Throughout the year, was responsible for the smooth deployment of **Accessible datasets**. While deployments may seem straightforward, they often involved unexpected challenges due to diverse client demands. Effectively addressing these issues has been crucial in upholding the **Client First Principle** at Morgan Stanley.

**Key Contributions:**  
 **Smoother Processes:** Implemented solutions that reduced recurring issues, enhancing accessibility and allowing teams to focus on major initiatives like **Config-Service**.
Documented the production deployment flow to streamline processes and reduce ad-hoc requests.
Established watchtower alerts for API connection failures from FDC APIs, facilitating proactive issue resolution.
Introduced retry logic for API connections, improving overall system reliability.


Impact Highlights:  
Taking charge of **Accessible framework** has allowed us to prioritize key projects, ultimately driving more impactful results for the business.



### Risk & Controls
This year, I’ve made it a priority to ensure every pull request, whether for **Config-Service** or **dzjava**, has been merged only after thorough unit or integration testing, bolstering the reliability and security of our systems.
- **dzjava**: **dzjava** has been designed with careful attention to detail, adhering to **SOLID principles** and maintaining strict **object-oriented** coding practices. This has made the codebase easy for developers to maintain and users to reference. Each code change in **dzjava** has been merged only after adding a relevant **integration test**, ensuring that changes don’t introduce regressions or affect system stability.
- **Documentation in dzjava**: I’ve also taken ownership of managing the **dzjava documentation**, ensuring it provides users with the most relevant and practical examples for all endpoints. This documentation has become a vital resource, guiding users to implement **dzjava** effectively, while minimizing confusion or misconfigurations when working with the API.
- **Security Models**: One of my key contributions has been enabling **OAuth Token Exchange** for the **dataset GET API** in **dzjava**. This added a critical layer of security, ensuring that sensitive data can only be accessed via proper authentication, aligning with the latest security standards.
**Config-Service**: Since this is a new project, we’ve introduced comprehensive **unit tests** to ensure robustness from the start.
- **Config-Service & Pydantic Model**: While integrating the **Pydantic Model** into the client-side of **dzpy** for easier configuration management, I thoughtfully implemented **LazyImport**. This ensures that:
  1. Users who are not directly dependent on this model are not impacted by any dependency-related issues.
  2. We avoid conflicting validations due to differences in the **Pydantic models** between the user side, client side, and server side, thus maintaining consistency and preventing clashes across environments.



### Culture & Values
- **Client First**: Took a more direct role in client interactions this year, independently managing one-on-one calls with Python and Java users, ensuring swift resolution of needs and smoother communication.
- **Accessible Framework**: Embracing the principle of **Common solutions for common problems**, I implemented several enhancements that streamlined processes for the team:
    - Documented the **prod deployment flow**, reducing the volume of ad-hoc requests.
    - Added **Watchtower alerts** for API connection failures from **FDC APIs**, along with automatic email notifications.
    - Introduced **retry logic** for handling API connection issues.
**Client-Centric Approach:** Dealt with unique failure messages and deployment issues, ensuring immediate responses at any time, regardless of the complexity.
- **Java Client Support**: Supported the **IED team** (Rushi Patel & team) by assisting them in onboarding their dataset, and worked with **Asma** on a client’s requirement, providing support and quick solutions.
**Security**: Contributed to enhancing our system’s security by working on the **OAuth Security model**. This ensures secure access to critical services and positions us to meet future client needs.
**Ownership of Pydantic Model for dzpy**: 
I proposed data-model-code-generator to convert server-side Pydantic schemas to client models, but it introduced dependencies affecting dzpy’s lightweight design. 
After leading discussions, we balanced dzpy’s size with usability. 
Jocelyn commended my leadership, highlighting collaboration and decision-making.
This work also led Enterprise Computing to seek my help on a Pydantic issue. The expertise I gained from this project also led to an individual from Enterprise Computing reaching out for assistance with a Pydantic issue they were facing, further showcasing the value and impact of this work.
Guiding Projects and Team Members
Had the chance to guide projects like Snowflake connectors and the data framework (Deep)
worked with Pallavi on Config-Service tasks. It wasn’t just about overseeing
It was a nice way to pass on what I’ve learned from our team and the Morgan Stanley culture to others.



### Professional Development

Reflecting on my goals set at the beginning of the year, I have made significant strides in several key areas:

1. **Standardizing Client Onboarding and Enhancing Client Experience**: The introduction of the Pydantic Model for clients has shown great progress in achieving this goal. Additionally, improvements in the accessible workflow have further enhanced the client experience. This goal remains an ongoing focus.

2. **Feature Parity in dzjava and dzpy**: Contributions such as the store endpoint and OAuth enablement have advanced this objective.

3. **Leadership in Breakout Calls**: I have actively participated in multiple breakout calls, taking ownership of discussions and decision-making processes.

4. **Personal Learning**: Early in this cycle, I completed a course on unit testing and Pytest, which has been beneficial in my work. I also delved into authentication principles, including Kerberos, OAuth, and OIDC, which was instrumental in my tasks.

5. **Proof of Concept on Serialization**: I explored a proof of concept for serialization in the dzjava store API. Although it wasn’t prioritized, it contributed to my learning.
